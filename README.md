<h2>Welcome!  üëã</h2>

Hello, my name is Arthur. I'm a Brazilian programming student currently pursuing an associate's degree, and this is my portfolio. I have a strong passion for programming, especially in the areas of backend development and data analysis. My primary programming language is PHP, using Laravel framework, and I also use Javascript and Python occasionally. Furthermore, I have experience with technologies such as NestJS, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Git, GitFlow and GitHub. Also, I'm familiar with MongoDB, MySQL, NodeJS and ExpressJS.

This year (2025), I'm focusing on networking and expanding my knowledge of PHP and Laravel. Additionally, I intend to write some technical articles throughout the year and share them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@arthurvinice). Check it out!
