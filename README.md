<h2>Welcome!  üëã</h2>

Hello, my name is Arthur. I'm a Brazilian programming student currently pursuing an associate's degree, and this is my portfolio. I have a strong passion for programming, especially in the areas of backend development and data analysis. My primary programming languages are Python and C++, and I also use JavaScript occasionally. Furthermore, I'm familiar with technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

This year (2024), I'm focusing on networking and expanding my knowledge of Node.js and MongoDB. Additionally, I intend to write some technical articles throughout the year and share them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@arthurvinice). Check it out!

* Studying
* Playing online games
* Listening to music
* Playing piano and guitar
* Learning new languages
* Practicing volleyball
